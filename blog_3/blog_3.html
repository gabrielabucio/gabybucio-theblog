        The third place that I recommend to visit in Spain is Mallorca. When I was sitting abroad in Madrid, and it was my spring break, I decided to go to my worker because wanted to swim and enjoy laying out in the sun. <br>
        Mallorca is the perfect place to enjoy a relaxing trip. <br> 
        I recommend flying to Mallorca and if you were flying to Mallorca and you are already in Spain, the flight should only be an hour. <br>
        When I was in Mallorca, I stayed in an air bnb and a lot of other people that I know visited Mallorca, did the same. The north coast of Mallorca is a lot quieter than the east and south but both areas are safe to stay in. <br>
        There are hotels too in Mallorca. I recommend getting the Airbnb app because it will make things a lot easier and you can easily book an Airbnb and split it with whoever you are traveling with. <br>
        In Mallorca my favorite thing that I did was spending time at the beach because it was so nice soaking up the sun and seeing the beautiful water. The water is so vibrant and turquoise. <br>
        I loved swimming in the  ocean and snorkeling. The beaches are safe and some of the most beautiful beaches in Mallorca is Cala Torta and Port dâ€™Alcudia. <br>
        There is a beautiful town in Mallorca called Valldemossa and it is a nice village to explore while in Mallorca. The city of Mallorca is perfect for a beach vacation and if you want to enjoy sunny weather! <br>
        Mallorca is definitely worth the travel and I really want to visit again and stay longer! <br>
