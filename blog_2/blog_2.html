    The second city that I recommend to visit in Spain is Barceleona. I spent a week in Barcelona while I was living in Madrid. <br>
    I took the train with my boyfriend and it was so comfortable and we got there so fast! I definitely recommended staying in neighborhoods that are close to all of the sightseeing. <br>
    I suggest getting an airbnb but you can also get a hotel! <br>
    When I visited Barcelona, I loved the architecture, especially Gaudi’s architecture, seeing a soccer game because the FC Barcelona soccer team at the stadium is very popular. <br>
    I recommend doing a tour of Camp Nou. Spain is known for their famous plate called paella and the best place to try paella is in Barcelona and I recommend trying this food at any restaurant. <br>
    Barcelona has a lot of Michelin star restaurants and really fun bars and clubs. The nightlife in Barcelona and Madrid is incredible and the clubs are so big and the music is amazing! <br>
    There is a lot of sightseeing to do and I recommend seeing the stunning Sagrada Familia which id a special church that took so long to build. <br>
    When I visited Barcelona, my favorite part of the trip was seeing the sagrada, Familia, and learning about every aspect of what went into building this church, and the meaning behind it. <br>
    Barcelona is a big city and there is a lot of things to do so I recommend planning out your days and getting tickets for activities on Tripadvisor! <br>
    I really enjoyed visiting Barcelona and I definitely want to go back and visit someday because there’s so much to see and the weather is so nice and I want to go back to relax on the beach! <br>
