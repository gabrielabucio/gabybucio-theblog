    The second city that I recommend to visit in Spain is Barceleona. I spent a week in Barcelona while I was living in Madrid. 
    I took the train with my boyfriend and it was so comfortable and we got there so fast! I definitely recommended staying in neighborhoods that are close to all of the sightseeing. 
    I suggest getting an airbnb but you can also get a hotel! 
    When I visited Barcelona, I loved the architecture, especially Gaudi’s architecture, seeing a soccer game because the FC Barcelona soccer team at the stadium is very popular. 
    I recommend doing a tour of Camp Nou. Spain is known for their famous plate called paella and the best place to try paella is in Barcelona and I recommend trying this food at any restaurant. 
    Barcelona has a lot of Michelin star restaurants and really fun bars and clubs. The nightlife in Barcelona and Madrid is incredible and the clubs are so big and the music is amazing! 
    There is a lot of sightseeing to do and I recommend seeing the stunning Sagrada Familia which id a special church that took so long to build. 
    When I visited Barcelona, my favorite part of the trip was seeing the sagrada, Familia, and learning about every aspect of what went into building this church, and the meaning behind it. 
    Barcelona is a big city and there is a lot of things to do so I recommend planning out your days and getting tickets for activities on Tripadvisor! 
    I really enjoyed visiting Barcelona and I definitely want to go back and visit someday because there’s so much to see and the weather is so nice and I want to go back to relax on the beach!
